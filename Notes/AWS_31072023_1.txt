-----------------------------
-> IAM service is FREE.
-> If an IAM user creates any Resources (like EC2, S3, EBS, RDS ..etc)
  then those are billable.

Note:
1. New AWS Accout --> Email/Pwd .... --> root Account.
2. Acc gets AccId Ex: 54789333412
3. Never directly work with Root Account in Orgs.
4. Always Create IAM with least privilege (only What they want).
5. If we choose checkbox "Users must create a new password at next sign-in"
   then user gets IAM Policy --> IAMUserChangePassword

What are use cases to create a User in AWS?
User --> 1. Console Login(open browser..do task)
	 2. CLI Access (Command Line)
	 3. SDK Access (Programming Access)
SDK / APIs --> Software Development Kit / Application Programming Interface

6. For every IAM user, we need to share
URL: https://shettyraghu.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
     https://088002525318.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
Un:  sam
Pwd: Test@1234

7. Policies are JSON Documents
Ex:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "___",     //What can we do (Create,Edit,Delete..etc)
            "Resource": "___"    //What can we use (EC2, RDS, IAM..etc)
        }
    ]
}

8. We can create Custom Policies by selecting required existed policies.
