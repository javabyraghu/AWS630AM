EC2, Linux, Windows, SG, 
Port Open(SSH/22, RDP/3389), AMI, Vol(8GB, 30GB).

IP : Internet Protocol.

Q) What is stop and stop an EC2 Instance, is Public IP being fixed?
A) If we stop and start, A new Public IP is assigned.

Fixed PubliIP : Elastic IP (AWS)

Note:
An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific Region only, and cannot be moved to a different Region.

Mumbai - Elastic IP ---> not access -> in HYD 

Elastic IP
1. Allocate Elastic IP	   : AWS Creates one Elastic IP and given to Your Account
2. Associate Elastic IP	   : Link Elastic IP with EC2 Instance	
3. Disassociate Elastic IP : Remove Link of Elastic IP with EC2 Instance	
4. Release Elastic IP	   : Give Elastic IP back to AWS Team.

By default, all AWS accounts are limited to 5 Elastic IP addresses per Region

If a Elastic IP is Associated with EC2 Instance, we will not get charged.
Only Allocated and Not Associated Elastic IPs are charged.
