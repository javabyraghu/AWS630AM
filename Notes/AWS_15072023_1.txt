-------------------
Working with LoadBalancer.
Step#1 Created instances manually
Step#2 Create one Target Group
Step#3 Create LoadBalancer using Target Group.

-----------------------------------------
ASG (Auto Scaling Group):
 It is used to manage no.of EC2 Instances based on Network Traffic
 (Resource Usage ie CPU Usage > 50%)
 We need to provide limits (min, max and desired)
 We need to configure Launch Template (Details for creating new EC2 Instance)
 Like AMI(OS), CPUs, Volume, Network, SG, KeyPair, Userdata..etc
 
ASG even needs/creates LB and TG.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-auto-scaling-groups-launch-template.html

AWS has given Mumbai Region with 3 AZe(ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b,ap-south-1c)
Launching a new EC2 instance. 
Status Reason: Your requested instance type (t2.micro)
is not supported in your requested Availability Zone (ap-south-1c)

At last Delete ASG, LB and TG.
