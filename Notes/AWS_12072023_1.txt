---------------------
To create EC2 Instance
=> Instance type
=> AMI
=> EBS
=> KeyPair
=> VPC + SG

.pem = Privacy Enhanced Mail.
=================================
Security Group:
1. Firewall / Contains all rules (What is allowed / not allowed)
2. Inbound Rules (all are disabled by default)
	Protocol  -- Port -- <From Where they can access>
	 HTTP         80          Every one (0.0.0.0)

3. Outbound Rules (all are enabled by default)
4. One SG can be used for Multiple Instances.
5. They are free to create and use.

ex: better to use one SG for same type/group of instances.
web_servers_sg
db_servers_sg

6. We can create SG while creating EC2 or before EC2 creation.
7. AWS provides on default SG. Default security groups cannot be deleted.

8. If a SG is connected with any Instances then it can not be deleted.
   Even if Instances are deleted, then SG is not deleted by default.
   You have to delete if you want.

Q) Can we change on EC2 Instance SG? (After creating EC2 Instance).
