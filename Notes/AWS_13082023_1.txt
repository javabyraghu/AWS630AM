AWS VPC (Virutal Private Cloud)

1. Networking : It is a process of connecting one machine with another.
2. AWS VPC is Networking concept given by AWS Cloud.
3. Without network (VPC) we can not create any Resource in AWS.
4. A default VPC is given by AWS Team (one per account).

5. Create a new VPC for your project
 -> Secure
 -> Isolate your resources
 -> Well Ordered
 -> Resource access using private/public subnets

6. CIDR is required for VPC to generate IP Address.
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method
  /32 ==> 2 pow (32 - 32) => 2 pow 0 => 1 (IP Address)
  /31 ==> 2 pow (32 - 31) => 2 pow 1 => 2 (IP Address)

ex: 10.0.0.0 / 16 
 => IP Address allocated to VPC : 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255

7. Types of Subnets:
 A. Public Subnet  : Allow Resources to be accessed by internet.
 	-> Connect to IGW (Internet Gateway)
	ex: Webservers, App Instances, Containers ..etc

 B. Private Subnet : Allow with in VPC (intranet/local)
 	-> Connect with only normal network.
    ex: Databases, Backups, Logs Server, ..etc

Recomanded:
 1 Subnet is created in 1 AZe.(ex: ap-south-1b)

8. Security:
 a. Network ACL (Access Control List) --> Subnet / VPC
 	-> What are allowed
	-> What are not allowed
	-> Define multiple rules in order
		Rule - 15 _______
		Rule - 22 _______
		...etc
	-> Recomanded at Network (VPC/Subnets) level.
 b. Security Group (Specify that what are allowed )
 	-> Recomanded at Resource Level (ex: Ec2, RDS)

9. NAT Gateway (Network Address Transilators)
  Private Subnets can not access internet.
  If they want to download some data (sudo yum update), it wont work.
  Then create a NAT in Public Subnet and connect to private Subnet.

========================================================================
VPC		: Private network given by AWS 
Subnet		: Small networks with IP ranges (Resource Isolation)
RouteTable	: Contains CIDR details Local(192.0.0.0/16) and IGW (0.0.0.0/0)
			1 Route Table ---- 1 Subnet / n -subnets

NAT		: For outbound traffic for private Subnet
CIDR		: IP Allocation process
Elastic IP	: Fixed Public IP for a Resource
Security Group	: for Resource level / What are allowd in
Network ACL	: For Subnet/VPC level (Allow/Deny)
VPC Peering	: One VPC to Another VPC connection.
