AWS Route 53
-> DNS Server given by AWS Cloud.
-> Purchase, Configure and Manage Domains (Hosted Zones).

-----What is DNS and Why it is----------
1. We runs apps using EC2 Instance and setup(Tomcat Server, WAR file..etc)
 [at least one EC2 Instance]

2. IPs are not fixed in realtime. Not easy to remember even.

3. In case multiple Instances are running for application high availability,
   then we use load balancer.
