AWS S3 : Simple Storage Service

-> Object Storage : Uploads/Downloads
	Images, Docs, Sheets, PDF, Video, Audio ..etc
-> We need to create buckets in S3
-> Names must be unique in Global
-> Every file is a Object.
-> No size limit for S3.
-> It stores file data, metadata(filename,size, ..etc) and UniqueId
-> Provide Security (Public Access, Private Access, WebBased Access)
-> Used for Files(upload/Download), Store backups, Logs, Static webhosting.
-> Supports even versioning (v1, v2)
-> we can stores files and folders (but taken as files only)

URL:
http:// <BucketName> .s3.amazonaws.com/<folderName>/<fileName>.<ext>
ex:
http://bank123App.s3.amazonaws.com/images/data.png

s3://raghu-test-2023-abc/assets/css/bootstrap.css

-> We can delete only Empty Buckets.
(Buckets must be empty before they can be deleted)
