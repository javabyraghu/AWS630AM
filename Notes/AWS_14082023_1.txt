---------------------
1. AWS has given one default VPC per one Region
2. Every Default VPC contains one Subnet per one AZe.
3. All these subnets are connected to one Route Table and one network ACL.
4. One IGW (internet gateway) is given in default VPC and connected to Route table.
Hint: 0.0.0.0/0 ==> Means Internet / IGW.
5. One Security Group is given by default VPC.
   But it is used as Firewall for Resources created inside Subnet.

6. one Network ACL is created by default VPC that behaves like
   firewall for subnets (Allow/Deny). This is connected with all subnets.

7. one Route table is given by default VPC and all subnets are connected.
8. A Physical Router is present, (managed by AWS) connected to Route Table.

9. We can disable - "Auto-assign public IP" in two cases,
   if a Resource is getting created in a Private Subnet.
   Communication can be done using private IP (same VPC)
   If a Resource is getting Elastic IP, then no use of temp public IP.

10. We can have EC2 instance connected to multiple Security Groups.
    One Security can have multiple Rules.

11. By default every EC2 Instance is created in default VPC.
    And choosing subnet preferences -- (any)

Q) What is network? Resources used for Networking?
Q) What is IP Address ?
Q) classes in IP Address?
Q) How many IPs are reserved/used by VPC in AWS?
Q) What is CIDR? How to calculate?

00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

IP address Range
0.0.0.0 => 255.255.255.255

Ex:
192.168.0.1 => 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001

Note:
-> Create your own VPC (1 for Project)
-> Do not repeate CIDRs ( no issue if we repeate CIDRs) for multiple VPCs.
-> if we try to do peering b/w VPC, they must have different CIDRs.
