---------------------------
AWS VPC
1. VPC - CIDR
2. Subnet (Public / Private)
   1 Subnet -- recomanded to be created in 1 AZe.
3. Route table 
 CIDR Details
 local -- 10.0.0.0/16
 IGW   -- 0.0.0.0/0
 Peering -- 172.168.0.0/16
4. Network ACL (Access Control List)
   Inbound / Outbound Firewall for Subnet
   Allow Rules / Deny Rules
   Multiple Rule in Order (lowest number -- highest Priority)
5. Security Group for Instances.
   Allow Rules (Protocol, Source)
6. IGW - Internet gateway
  1 IGW -- 1 VPC
==============================================================
Q) How can we SSH into EC2 Instance Present in Private Subnet?
   (Even PublicIP may or may not present).

A) We can not directly SSH into Private Subnet Instances.
   We need to create one Instance in Public Subnet, that will connect
   to private Subnet Instances.
   Such Instance is called as Bastion Host / Jum Box / Jump Server.

-> Create EC2 in Public Subnet and EC2 in Private Subnet.
-> Connect to Public Subnet Instance and execute below commands
(First Upload Pem file in MobaXterm after SSH Connection)
    1  ls -la
    2  chmod 400 AWS.pem  / chown ec2-user:ec2-user AWS.pem
    3  ls -la
    4  ssh -i AWS.pem ec2-user@<PrivateSubnetEC2PrivateIP>
    5  ls
    6  exit
=================================================================
Requirement:
1. Create Instance in Private Subnet
2. ** Do not allow Internet Access to EC2 Instance (Never add IGW)
3. But sometimes required Outbound data for Private Subnet Instances
 Ex: OS updates, S/w Install.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html
NAT Gateway is used to connect Private Subnet Instances with Internet
Only for Outbound data/ download data from outside.
but External/Outside services can not access our instances.

NAT must be created in Public Subnet.
NAT must be registered with Private Subnet Route table.
 like 0.0.0.0/0 --- nat-0045756467


Follow these steps:
1. First Remove Entry from Private Route table (NAT GW Entry)
2. Delete NAT GW
3. Release Elastic IP
4. Terminate EC2 Instances
5. Edit Route table Subnet Associations and then delete
6. Delete VPC.
