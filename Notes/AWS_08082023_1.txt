-------------------
AWS EFS:
1. Shared Network Storage 
2. We can connect multiple EC2 Instances 
	to share/store common files.
3. NFS[EFS] Protocol (2049 Port need to be open in SG)
4. Auto Scaled Memory Management. [EFS Size is dynamic]
5. Pay per usage (Based on Uploaded content/data exist)
6. AWS EFS is a Managed Service 
 (Replicas, Backups/snapshots, LifeCycle Management is automated)
7. Storage classes:
	a. Standard : Store data as High Available.
	b. One Zone : Store data in single AZe.
	c. Standard IA
	d. One Zone IA
8. Security : Role management is used from IAM to connect with EFS.
 SAM (User/UserGroups [Policies]) ---> AWS Console/CLI/SDK
 MyRole-1 (Roles [Policies]) --> AWS Resource-1(EC2) --- AWS Resource-2(AWS EFS)

9. AWS EFS : Store only files. 
	-> Install OS (Not possible)
	-> Install Apps (Not Possible)
10. Performance Mode:
	General Purpose: Regular Operations (Create/Edit/Copy/..etc)
	Max I/O : Used for complex, lengthy files..etc

--After Creating EFS and EC2 Instances-------
1. Create a Folder
$ mkdir mydata

2. Update User permissions
$ sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user mydata

3. Open NFS Port in Security Group.
(AWS Console)

4. Install EFS Tools in EC2 (to do mounting)
$ sudo yum install amazon-efs-utils -y

5. Execute Mount command at EC2
$ sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-0b999b4634b25fbd9:/ mydata

6. Create some files / edit if already exist

7. Unmount 
$ cd ..
$ sudo umount mydata

8. Before Unmounting try to create 2nd EC2 Instance and try same.
